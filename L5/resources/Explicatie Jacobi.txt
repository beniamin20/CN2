% The Jacobi method is an iterative algorithm that given a system of ecuations
% in the form A*x = b will provide x~ an aproximation for x.
% Below is an explication in natural language of the approach.

% Not: n - number of ecuations. 
% We can rething about the given system A*x = b as:
% For i=1:n:  
%    sum A(i,j)*x(j) = b(i) -  where j takes values from 1 to n

% The sum is echivalent to:
% A(i,i)*x(i,i) + sum A(i,j)*x(j) = b(i) | where j takes values from 1 to n \ {i}

% Which in turn can be written as:
% x(i,i) = 1/A(i,i) * (b(i) - sum A(i,j)*x(j) | where j takes values from 1 to n \ {i}

% Now if we consider the left side of the above expresion as the current aproximation of x
% And the right side of as the previous aproximation of x what we have is the Jacobi method
% The initial aproximation of x is [0; 0 ... ;0]

% We can implement this using matrix operations. 
% A(i,i) can be switched with the diagonal matrix M = diag(diag(A))
% A(i,j) - i=1:n ; j=1:n can be switched with N = M - A
% x(i,i) - is replaced by simply x (curent|previous)
